### GOQ_Q9: Is it possible to construct truly free social media owned by individual free software programmers?



GNU tools and Linux are in fact products of reverse engineering. They were just too successful that this fact has been overlooked as they have become the de facto standard, rather than being seen as the "clones". And clones they are -- clones of the Unix operating system and tools that began exactly 50 years ago.

Show old links like Stallman interview first. Get people's interest. Then write new article

The purpose of this article, besides reminiscing the past, is to look at the future.

Almost 3 decades have passed since the Linux kernel was first released. In the years that followed, github.com, also started by Linus Torvalds himself, has been acquired by its former nemesis, Microsoft Corporation, one of whose former CEO Steve Balmer having accused Linux as Communism.

Free software based on GNU tools and Linux have nurtured the majority of the top ten of software companies today. As innovations in software peter out, an inescapable sign of maturity, it is perhaps high time to reconsider the plausibility and possibility of reverse engineering the software platforms owned by these billion dollars companies, which rely on free software components in the first place.


#### GOQ as a Prototype of GNU Cloud

Graph of Questions (GOQ) is based on a very simple idea: linking a markdown article (on GitHub or equivalent) to a question. Detailed discussions about the rationales and benefits of GOQ can be found in related [GOQ_Q* questions](https://github.com/udexon/GOQ). In this article, we will focus on how to develop GOQ as a prototype of GNU Cloud and using GOQ / GNU Cloud to build up the team with the objective of developing GNU Cloud.

We believe the prime obstacle in developing an initiative like GNU Cloud in the past has been finding an incremental development model, i.e. something like GOQ. As some readers may notice, GOQ simply make use of GitHub as a storage platform. All other operations can simply be performed via HTTP GET. Prior to this, most free or proprietary projects would build up their own web based or SQL platoforms or protocol, making an incremental development model difficult, as the incompatible protocols amongst projects resulted in fragmentation of development effort.

Sharing most current ideas, need a flexible platform. Build the team to develop the code, recursive?
