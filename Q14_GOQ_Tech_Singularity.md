### #GOQ_Q14
- How does Graph of Questions relate to technological singularity?

Graph of Questions (GOQ) is designed to overcome the shortcomings of existing web tools and complement them, specifically focusing on the roles of questions and answers (Q&A) in human communications.

The widespread of social media has proven that Internet users are very productive in producing short or brief comments -- corresponding to the length and depth of verbal comments during face to face conversations. In contrast, writing full length article is much more demanding, which may not convey as much information compared to "post"-length comments in social media forums.

Graph of Questions is a novel method of organizing such post-length comments as a collection of answers to questions. The dozen or so questions in GOQ so far have illustrated the breadth and depth of GOQ from a single author (GitHub user udexon), ranging from: 
- knowledge representation (GOQ), 
- software engineering (homoiconism for various programming languages), to 
- artificial intelligence.

We believe GOQ can be an enabler which further levels the playing fields for techical professionals, such as programmers, who may not have the time and resources to write extensively, compared to academics and students in universities.

A question is a trigger for a reader (human or machine) to begin the process to find the answers.

The reader may or may not find an answer.

However, if a question is published on the Internet, N readers may attempt in it, increasing the likelihood to obtain answers.

The proposal for homoiconic robotics with Android Java sensors at this stage is a question, or an incomplete answer, as we have laid out some basic principles, but do not have the working homoiconic code yet.

An answer may lead to more questions and may also be incomplete.Â 

Singularity is about time of arrival and resources required.

Homoiconism 10 years. 2030, 2029, owned by who?

When I read reactive sensors code, I have only seen familiar words like emitter, so I assume it may lead to something I want, and I assume I understand.
