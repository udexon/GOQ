- How does Graph of Questions relate to technological singularity?

Graph of Questions (GOQ) is designed to overcome the shortcomings of existing web tools and complement them, specifically focusing on the roles of questions and answers (Q&A) in human communications.

The widespread of social media has proven that Internet users are very productive in producing short or brief comments -- corresponding to the length and depth of verbal comments during face to face conversations. In contrast, writing full length article is much more demanding, which may not convey as much information compared to "post"-length comments in social media forums.

Graph of Questions is a novel method of organizing such post-length comments as a collection of answers to questions. The dozen or so questions in GOQ so far have illustrated the breadth and depth of GOQ from a single author (GitHub user udexon), ranging from: 
- knowledge representation (GOQ), 
- software engineering (homoiconism for various programming languages), to 
- artificial intelligence.

We believe GOQ can be an enabler which further levels the playing fields for techical professionals, such as programmers, who may not have the time and resources to write extensively, compared to academics and students in universities.

A question is a trigger for a reader (human or machine) to begin the process to find the answers.

The reader may or may not find an answer.

An answer may lead to more questions and may also be incomplete. 

However, if a question is published on the Internet, N readers may attempt in it, increasing the likelihood to obtain answers.

The proposal for homoiconic robotics with Android Java sensors at this stage is a question, or an incomplete answer, as we have laid out some basic principles, but do not have the working homoiconic code yet. We hope that readers who have similar interests or who are more familiar with Android Java sensors would be able to contribute. As such, GOQ serves to attract more contributors with similar interests although some of the collaborators do not have the complete answer yet.


### #GOQ_Q15
- Can you explain the efforts required in working towards technological singularity using non-technical analogies?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi

- The Tamagotchi (たまごっち, IPA: [tamaɡotꜜtɕi]) is a handheld digital pet, created in Japan by Akihiro Yokoi [ja] of WiZ and Aki Maita of Bandai. It was released by Bandai on November 23, 1996 in Japan and May 1, 1997 in the rest of the world, quickly becoming one of the biggest toy fads of the 1990s and early 2000s.

With the widespread of mobile phones, by 2020, almost everyone on Earth can have a replica of Tamagotchi to carry around all day long. Tamagotchi is an apt analogy as it does not do much. In the earliest phase of our Countdown Towards Technological Singularity (CTTS), users and programmers should perhaps view their mobile phones like a Tamagotchi, but potentially to be developed to be an ancestor of R2D2, the Star Wars droid which produces funny sound and only move on wheels by 2030.

Again, an ancestor of R2D2, perhaps to be called R0D0, is an apt analogy, as a droid moving on wheels producing funny sounds would not be too demanding for a boy faraway in Karnataka, India, to develop. In fact, by 2019, Boston Dynamics has already produced a humanoid soldier who can point and shoot, not reacting towards its human owners although being abused, as shown in a recent promotional video.

In short, out Countdown Towards Technological Singularity (CTTS) will consists of developing a Tamagotchi clone in 2020 to producing R0D0 by 2030.


Tamagotchi and R2D2

React native sensors -- more programmer adoption. Good sign.



Singularity is about time of arrival and resources required.

Homoiconism 10 years. 2030, 2029, owned by who?

When I read reactive sensors code, I have only seen familiar words like emitter, so I assume it may lead to something I want, and I assume I understand.
