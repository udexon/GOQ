Search engines, Wikipedia, Quora etc. encourage in depth answers but narrow views. Oftentimes, the user does not know what else are the topics that are related to his (her) question and these websites do not address this problem.

Graph of Questions aim to be like [Tree of Life web project](http://tolweb.org/tree/), to construct a graph database and allow users to visualize it.

We will start using the simplest method: by using github.com itself as database, as it supports Markdown format which most programmers are familiar with. The rest of the visualization modules can be built on the client side, or on web pages which access github markdown files directly.

So this will be the starting point of Graph of Questions for now:

- https://github.com/udexon/GOQ

ALL are welcome to collaborate. All collaborations will be updated on the starting page.

It is called a graph but not tree as we ensivage that if anyone think it is a good idea, he (she) will fork it and make another starting point for Graph of Questions.

By the way, I started this project as an experiment to address issues related to technological singularity:

- Q1: How do we overcome the media control imposed by the bourgeousie and escape the wrath of technological singularity?

- Q2: [How does Graph of Questions overcome media control?](https://github.com/udexon/GOQ/blob/master/Q2_Media_Control.md)

So you may now claim Q3, ....
