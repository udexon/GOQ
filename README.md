# Graph of Questions
## GOQ: Graph of Questions --- a Collaborative Project to Construct an Index to ALL Questions

- The general population dosen't know whats happening and it doesn't even know that it doesn't know.

Search engines, Wikipedia, Quora etc. encourage in depth answers but narrow views. Oftentimes, the user does not know what else are the topics that are related to his (her) question and these websites do not address this problem.

Graph of Questions aim to be like [Tree of Life web project](http://tolweb.org/tree/), to construct a graph database and allow users to visualize it.

We will start using the simplest method: by using github.com itself as database, as it supports Markdown format which most programmers are familiar with. The rest of the visualization modules can be built on the client side, or on web pages which access github markdown files directly.

So this will be the starting point of Graph of Questions for now:

- https://github.com/udexon/GOQ

ALL are welcome to collaborate. All collaborations will be updated on the starting page.

It is called a graph but not tree as we ensivage that if anyone think it is a good idea, he (she) will fork it and make another starting point for Graph of Questions.

By the way, I started this project as an experiment to address issues related to technological singularity:

- GOC_Q1: How do we overcome the media control imposed by the bourgeousie and escape the wrath of technological singularity?

- GOQ_Q2: [How does Graph of Questions overcome media control?](https://github.com/udexon/GOQ/blob/master/Q2_Media_Control.md)

- GOQ_Q3: [ What would be the best interface to present the ideas or repositories owned by `udexon` to  third parties who are unfamiliar with his work?](https://github.com/udexon/GOQ/blob/master/Q2_Media_Control.md#GOQ_Q3)
- GOQ_Q4: [ How may one model the mechanisms of a programmer writing programs? ](https://github.com/udexon/GOEHDOM/blob/master/Homoiconicity.md)
- GOQ_Q5: Will GOQ_Q4 be drown by other questions, e.g. by parties who have vested interested in media control?
- GOQ_Q6: [ What is (are) the main difference(s) between face to face communications and online communications? ](https://github.com/udexon/GOQ/blob/master/Q6_diff_face_online.md#goq_q6-what-is-are-the-main-differences-between-face-to-face-communications-and-online-communications)
- GOQ_Q7: [ Can we implement the difference(s) in GOQ_Q6 in online communications? ](https://github.com/udexon/GOQ/blob/master/Q6_diff_face_online.md#goq_q7-can-we-implement-the-differences-in-goq_q6-in-online-communications)
- GOQ_Q8: [ What are the differences between Quora and GOQ? ](https://github.com/udexon/GOQ/blob/master/Q6_diff_face_online.md#goq_q8-what-are-the-differences-between-quora-and-goq)

For convenience, each question is labeled with GOQ_[Question_Number].

You may extend the GOQ label with your GitHub Username (or equivalent) and Repository name, e.g.

- JSmith_Hello_GOQ_Q1

Updating the question database consists of simply running `grep GOQ_` over markdown files.

More complex HTML and Markdown tagging such as <a name> can be automated with various client side commands, creating a client-server ecosystem based on GitHub, a powerful and virtually unlimited storage backed by Linus Torvalds and Microsoft!
