### Graph of Questions Q2: How does Graph of Questions overcome media control?

The history of media control began with the first ever inscription on a surface in primitive societies. Inscriptions in primitive societies were of course associated with authority. By default, only authorized personnel had access to sacred and scarce surfaces (wall, tree, stone, bamboo slabs).

The availability of mechanized printing coincided with the Christian Reformation -- a civil war amongst European nations due to different interpretations of Christian teachings -- which eventually led to a new era of critical thinking.

From early 17th century to early 20th century, the world enjoyed a short period of growth of critical thinking, with the publications of newspapers, until the invention of television, which ushered in the age of manufactured conscent.

The second decade of the 21st century witnessed the maturity of mobile phones and social media, as well as the increasing sophistication of media control.

It is in this background, Graph of Questions is conceived.
