### Graph of Questions Q2: How does Graph of Questions overcome media control?

The history of media control began with the first ever inscription on a surface in primitive societies. Inscriptions in primitive societies were of course associated with authority. By default, only authorized personnel had access to sacred and scarce surfaces (wall, tree, stone, bamboo slabs).

The availability of mechanized printing coincided with the Christian Reformation -- a civil war amongst European nations due to different interpretations of Christian teachings -- which eventually led to a new era of critical thinking.

From early 17th century to early 20th century, the world enjoyed a short period of growth of critical thinking, with the publications of newspapers, until the invention of television, which ushered in the age of manufactured conscent.

The second decade of the 21st century witnessed the maturity of mobile phones and social media, as well as the increasing sophistication of media control.

It is against this background, Graph of Questions is conceived.

For example, a press release by a giant corporation such as Google will get shared and upvoted by a large number of Redditors. 

New ideas may reach their targeted audience but are usually restricted within specialized subreddits. 

Graph of Questions is designed to overcome such discrepancies.

For example, a dedicated programmer would normally work on a project consistently over several months, publishing posts or relevant comments at various platforms.

GOQ provides an integrated platform for such programmer together with related experts, by linking related posts and comments from various platforms over a period of time. 

Perhaps the easiest and best example to illustrate the use of GOQ is the author of GOQ itself:

- https://github.com/udexon

I believe there many programmers or non-programmer experts like `udexon` who have posts and comments on various social media platforms.

- GOQ_Q3: What would be the best interface to present the ideas or repositories owned by `udexon` to  third parties who are unfamiliar with his work?
- Answer: A question specifically relating to a markdown article.

e.g. 

- GOQ_Q4: How may one model the mechanisms of a programmer writing programs?
- Answer: https://github.com/udexon/GOEHDOM/blob/master/Homoiconicity.md

As you can see, a question is more informative than a subject heading which is usually an incomplete sentence. Further, a question may have more than one answers. Related questions may be easily group together for further analysis or exploration.

Now imagine the effects of hundreds of questions similar to the above on the consciousness of the 99% of the population:

- A question has an anonymous leveling effect compared to a subject heading, which a reader would normally associate it to an author, and may prejudice against the article by the fame of the author.

- GOQ_Q5: Will GOQ_Q4 be drown by other questions, e.g. by parties who have vested interested in media control?



(I am writing this on an on-going basis. If you are impatient, please leave me a message. I am also finding new evidence that Graph of Questions is an effective and productive format to organize impromptu writings.)
