### GOQ_Q6: What is (are) the main difference(s) between face to face communications and online communications?

Answer: Impromptu questions and answers.

When two persons meet face to face, the most effective communications comes in the form of dialogue, or questions and answers. 

In online communications, forum discussions capture the essesence of dialogue, thus becoming the most effective form of online communications, for example, to discuss live topics, as well as in depth. e.g. Reddit.

Other than that, most of online communications take the form of web page, which is primarily based on traditional document, with additional hyperlinks.

Traditional document has developed over millennia and was not designed for impromptu communications, as the medium for writing, paper, was a scarce resource.


### GOQ_Q7: Can we implement the difference(s) in GOQ_Q6 in online communications?

We only need to implement a small change to the conventional web page -- add questions. The end result is Graph of Questions.

This novelty, although simple, is not in the curriculum of education in most countries. As such, it may take some time to popularize this format.


### GOQ_Q8: What are the differences between Quora and GOQ?

Quora has many restrictions compared to GOQ which is an open architecture project. Any programmers can contribute to GOQ code and database.

GOQ can be used as a master index to Quora questions and other platforms.

Quora is not designed for top level experts --- who are too busy to write long answers.

Quora users are also not top level experts --- they do not know top level questions that only top level experts know.

So top level experts need a system like GOQ to manage questions. Oftentimes, these questions are questions to self or questions for a small circle of collaborators.

However ordinary users can also understand GOQ easily, because questions and answers is fundamental to human communications. Additional, explanatory questions can be added to top level questions to help non-experts.
